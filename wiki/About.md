# About NIOS

**The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS),** formerly known as the National Open School (NOS), was established in November 1989 as an autonomous organisation in pursuance of the National Policy on Education, 1986, by the Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India. NIOS offers a wide range of vocational, life enrichment, and community-oriented courses, in addition to general and academic courses at the secondary and senior secondary levels. It also provides elementary-level courses through its Open Basic Education Programmes (OBE). 

The Government of India, through a gazette notification, granted NIOS the authority to examine and certify learners registered with it up to pre-degree level courses, whether academic, technical, or vocational. The Association of Indian Universities, via letter No. EV/11(354)/91 dated 25 July 1991, recognized the equivalence of the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination conducted by NIOS.
