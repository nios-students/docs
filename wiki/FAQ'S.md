# TMA FAQs

# Isn't the marks for TMA 20% more than the maximum theory marks?

Ans: For some who are wondering ‚Äúwait, if we add this up, it would be 116 marks in total?! How so?‚Äù, well NIOS follows a bit different rule compared to other boards here. See the 16 marks assigned in TMA is added up **by deducting 20% of marks from Public Examination, i.e. theory paper** so for example if you scored 14 marks in your TMA and 60 marks in your public exam, 20% of the marks from public exams are cut 20%  of 60 marks = 12 marks.

# Why does TMA marks shown more than 20% of theory marks?

Ans: From October 2024 session, TMA evaluation pattern has been changed. As we know in Theory, full marks on Question Paper and on Marksheet remain different. (TMA marks are adjusted after calculation) So, 100 becomes 80, 80 becomes 64. Same will be followed for TMA now onwards. Earlier TMA marks was uploaded after calculating 20% of Theory marks. e.g. Home Science 216, on Dashboard full marks for TMA is 20 but on Marksheet it'll be calculated out of 17. If for same subject, Dashboard is showing 18 then take it as 18 out of 20 which will become on marksheet 15 out of 17 after calculation.  

Table attached showing full TMA marks of all Subjects on Marksheet (20% of Theory Marks). Now you can calculate Actual TMA marks by yourself:

1. Just write the info before the answers start.
2. Use canva to make and fill it then use a pdf editor to place it before the answers start.
3. Use per-made front page from the internet and take print out of it write your info on it. Remember to scan it before the answers start.

# PCP and study centre related FAQs

# Which PCP is important? (Only for Stream 1)

Ans: The first PCP in December-November (block 1) June- July (block 2) doesn't carry any marks. FA PCP Carries **50% weightage of Practicals** [Read More...](https://nios-students.pages.dev/wiki/Exams-Assignments#pcp-personal-contact-programme)

# What do if my AI (Study Centre) is closed or no longer affiliated NIOS?

Ans: Firstly chill it's not a big deal if this happened to you. Let's confirm.

1. Log on to your dashboard ‚¨áÔ∏è Scroll down. Click on "`üëÅÔ∏è` View." You will see the "PCP details 2021-22" at the top ignore that it's a bug. There should be a table below that. **Btw these PCPs are the non-important ones i.e. 30 classes. if can you see "No record found" That means that your study center is not affiliated with NIOS. ‚ÄúHow to do you know?‚Äù Because I'm god yes, I'm serious!**. *Read the note at the end*
2. Go to the Centre in person
3. Call your regional office and ask them [**Click here to view phone number**](https://web.archive.org/web/20220216190435/https://sdmis.nios.ac.in/home/regional-center)







They just don't want more students in the center because they're so overworked and stuff. And they might not even conduct anything. So what I need you to do is prepare practicals and all of that stuff on your own. If you don't understand anything, just go on Reddit. Or we are planning to make this, guide every session that it's not base it's not, like, return information because I think, people don't read whatever I write in the VQs anyways.


You don't have to do anything. Your regional center has a record of it

What I have observed is that in the main practical examination itself, they will fill both of these marks. Yes. In the notifications that they say that, yeah, there is a separate schedule for uploading, FA marks and SA marks that is FAPCPs and the practical exam itself. But when you, like, you know, when you go to the examination, they will probably give you a answer if you I unfortunately don't have a copy of it, like, a picture of it or anything. So yeah.

Why do they need to add the FA marks column on the answersheet when they can just pull it (The marks FA) from the website itself. This proves that, both are entered at the practical examination. 


Now if the if your study center does not conduct it or if your study center is closed and the other center you will read does not conduct the PCB classes, every PCB classes. In most cases, they will, give the remarks for that for free. For free, that's that that does not mean that if you don't attend the, practical examination, you will just get 50% of the your practical marks.

And and if you're in 12, you'll just basically pass practical without doing nothing. No. They won't do that. You have to go to the practical examination. You have to submit the file.




# Public examination FAQs


# What is the gap? (this for freshers of **12th Senior Secondary** only)

Ans: There must be at least a 2 year gap between passing 10th grade and passing 12th.
- If you passed 10th grade
(April 2024, or October 2024) and are taking 12th grade exams in April-May 2025, you can only pay exam fees for up to 4 subjects. (You can 4 sebjects or 1 sebject or not give any sebject)
- If you pay for more than 4 subjects and don‚Äôt meet the 2 year gap, your results won‚Äôt be declared.

Note: If you finish your exams in the second year NIOS will give your result documents after you give all sebjects i.e. after the second exam results are declared.
