# Isn't the marks for TMA 20% more than the maximum theory marks?
Ans: For some who are wondering “wait, if we add this up, it would be 116 marks in total?! How so?”, well NIOS follows a bit different rule compared to other boards here. See the 16 marks assigned in TMA is added up **by deducting 20% of marks from Public Examination, i.e. theory paper** so for example if you scored 14 marks in your TMA and 60 marks in your public exam, 20% of the marks from public exams are cut
20%  of 60 marks = 12 marks
