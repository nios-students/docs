# Isn't the marks for TMA 20% more than the maximum theory marks?

Ans: For some who are wondering “wait, if we add this up, it would be 116 marks in total?! How so?”, well NIOS follows a bit different rule compared to other boards here. See the 16 marks assigned in TMA is added up **by deducting 20% of marks from Public Examination, i.e. theory paper** so for example if you scored 14 marks in your TMA and 60 marks in your public exam, 20% of the marks from public exams are cut
20%  of 60 marks = 12 marks.

# What is the gap? (this for freshers of **12th** only)

Ans: There must be at least a 2-year gap between passing 10th grade and passing 12th.
- If you passed 10th grade after April 2023 (e.g., October 2023, April 2024, or October 2024) and are taking 12th-grade exams in April-May 2025, you can only pay exam fees for up to 4 subjects.  
- If you pay for more than 4 subjects and don’t meet the 2-year gap, your results won’t be declared.

# I just Public Exam now i wanna register for the upcoming Public Exam but it won't let me why is that?

Ans: Please wait until results of the exam you gave are released. NIOS will make other schedule for you. [Join our WhatsApp update channel](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VamKd7w3LdQV8AqlNF1h)
