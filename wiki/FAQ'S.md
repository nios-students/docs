# TMA FAQs

# Isn't the marks for TMA 20% more than the maximum theory marks?

Ans: For some who are wondering ‚Äúwait, if we add this up, it would be 116 marks in total?! How so?‚Äù, well NIOS follows a bit different rule compared to other boards here. See the 16 marks assigned in TMA is added up **by deducting 20% of marks from Public Examination, i.e. theory paper** so for example if you scored 14 marks in your TMA and 60 marks in your public exam, 20% of the marks from public exams are cut 20%  of 60 marks = 12 marks.

# Why does TMA marks shown more than 20% of theory marks?

Ans: From October 2024 session, TMA evaluation pattern has been changed. As we know in Theory, full marks on Question Paper and on Marksheet remain different. (TMA marks are adjusted after calculation) So, 100 becomes 80, 80 becomes 64. Same will be followed for TMA now onwards. Earlier TMA marks was uploaded after calculating 20% of Theory marks. e.g. Home Science 216, on Dashboard full marks for TMA is 20 but on Marksheet it'll be calculated out of 17. If for same subject, Dashboard is showing 18 then take it as 18 out of 20 which will become on marksheet 15 out of 17 after calculation.  

Table attached showing full TMA marks of all Subjects on Marksheet (20% of Theory Marks). Now you can calculate Actual TMA marks by yourself:

> Note: **'Theory' refers to subjects without practical e.g. Social science, History**. [Sebject names with corresponding sebject code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IkOCPBsEOd-owsX70-DvP0b5epAoJob3zEtI3OGJUMs/edit?usp=drive_link)

**Why don‚Äôt they conduct PCP?**

They‚Äôre overworked and busy with CBSE responsibilities.

**What can I do now?**

You need to prepare for your practicals and record book/practical file on your own. If you don‚Äôt understand something, just visit [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOS_Students) or [read this](https://nios-students.pages.dev/wiki/howto-rec-book). You don‚Äôt have to do anything else‚Äîyour Regional Centre has a record of inactive study centres. Now, if your study centre does not conduct FA PCP, or if your study centre is closed and the other centre does not conduct PCP classes either, in most cases they will give you the FA PCP marks.

# Public examination FAQs


# What is the gap? (this for freshers of **12th Senior Secondary** only)

Ans: There must be at least a 2 year gap between passing 10th grade and passing 12th.
- If you passed 10th grade
(April 2024, or October 2024) and are taking 12th grade exams in April-May 2025, you can only pay exam fees for up to 4 subjects. (You can 4 sebjects or 1 sebject or not give any sebject)
- If you pay for more than 4 subjects and don‚Äôt meet the 2 year gap, your results won‚Äôt be declared.

Note: If you finish your exams in the second year NIOS will give your result documents after you give all sebjects i.e. after the second exam results are declared.

# Can an exam centre be changed (PE)?

Ans: Yes there is a e-service that however, it just returns " Change of exam center is now closed." YOU can't change the exam centre. 

# Where are the practical examination held?

Ans: Practical examinations for Public examinations are normally held in the respective AIs, where the learner gets enrolled. If your AI/Study centre is inactive or closed another centre will be allocated to you.

# Will my marks be carried forward?

Ans: At Sr.Secondary level, if one fails in theory but passes in practical, do they have to appear in practical again and vica versa. If learner passes in practical but fails in the theory of a subject, his/her practical awards/marks will be retained and can appear in theory examination only. In case the learner re-appears in both theory and practical, then the best combination of marks will be retained.
