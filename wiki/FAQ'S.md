# Isn't the marks for TMA 20% more than the maximum theory marks?

Ans: For some who are wondering “wait, if we add this up, it would be 116 marks in total?! How so?”, well NIOS follows a bit different rule compared to other boards here. See the 16 marks assigned in TMA is added up **by deducting 20% of marks from Public Examination, i.e. theory paper** so for example if you scored 14 marks in your TMA and 60 marks in your public exam, 20% of the marks from public exams are cut 20%  of 60 marks = 12 marks.

# Why does TMA marks shown more than 20% of theory marks?

Ans: From October 2024 session, TMA evaluation pattern has been changed. As we know in Theory, full marks on Question Paper and on Marksheet remain different. (TMA marks are adjusted after calculation) So, 100 becomes 80, 80 becomes 64. Same will be followed for TMA now onwards. Earlier TMA marks was uploaded after calculating 20% of Theory marks. e.g. Home Science 216, on Dashboard full marks for TMA is 20 but on Marksheet it'll be calculated out of 17. If for same subject, Dashboard is showing 18 then take it as 18 out of 20 which will become on marksheet 15 out of 17 after calculation.  

Table attached showing full TMA marks of all Subjects on Marksheet (20% of Theory Marks). Now you can calculate Actual TMA marks by yourself:

# What is the gap? (this for freshers of **12th Sr.Sec** only)

Ans: There must be at least a 2-year gap between passing 10th grade and passing 12th.
- If you passed 10th grade after April 2023 (e.g., October 2023, April 2024, or October 2024) and are taking 12th-grade exams in April-May 2025, you can only pay exam fees for up to 4 subjects.  
- If you pay for more than 4 subjects and don’t meet the 2-year gap, your results won’t be declared.

# I gave Public Exam now i wanna register for the upcoming Public Exam but it won't let me why is that?

Ans: Please wait until results of the exam you gave are released. NIOS will make other schedule for you. It takes two or three weeks after the results are released.
