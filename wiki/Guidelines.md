# NIOS Exam Scribe Process

I'm writing from experience as I took the April 2024 exams with a scribe. Firstly, NIOS or the exam center will not provide a scribe/writer. You have to find one by yourself.

## Documents Required
1. Application by the Parent
2. Medical Certificate
3. Copy of Disability Certificate
4. Study Certificate
5. Student ID card of the school and Aadhaar card of the writer/scribe
6. NIOS ID card of the learner

Xerox copies work.

## How can I find and fill these documents?
First, visit the NIOS website and download the Application by the Parent and Medical Certificate from the [Provisions for Learners with Disability](https://nios.ac.in/departmentsunits/evaluation/general-and-specific-relaxations-(disability-wise)-during-nios-examination.aspx). Take a printout of these documents.

### How to fill out the Application by the Parent:
1. Name of the person filling out the form
2. Relationship to the learner
3. Permanent address
4. Phone number
5. Email address
6. Today's date
7. The name of your RC (see your ID card right side and write the name of the city)
8. Tick one option (use a black pen)
9. Start and end date of the exam (if the datesheet isn't released yet, write the first and last date of the months. For example, "April exam '1st of April year' to '1st of May year'")
10. Tick the correct option
11. Name of the learner
12. Enrollment number of the learner
13. Tick the course enrolled in
14. Write the nature of the disability (e.g., if you have low vision, write "Blindness")
15. Get your disability certificate and write the hospital's name there
16. Sl. No should be at the top right corner
17. Write the date given on the disability certificate
18. Fill the table with the subjects you paid exam fees for
19. Write "Yes" under "Self-arranged" for all subjects. Write "Scribe" in the right-side column (for all subjects).

### Is a medical certificate required?
Yes, without the medical certificate, the form will not be accepted.

### How to fill the Medical Certificate:
1. Who can fill it? The hospital you go to for checkups or any government hospital.
2. Make sure that you have the signature and seal of the doctor and hospital.
3. Write this in the last line: "E Blindness/Low-vision" and "Scribe and reader is required."

### How to fill out the Study Certificate:
Just fill in the format given below:

```
STUDY CERTIFICATE

This is to certify that [Name of the scribe] is a bonafide student of the above-cited school, i.e., [Name of school with address]. As per the admission register, his Adm. No is [Adm. No]. He joined the school in the academic year [academic year] for Std [Grade when he/she was admitted to the school]. His date of birth given is [DOB].

```

## Next Steps
1. Scan all documents using [Oken Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cambyte.okenscan).
2. Mail them to your RC (RC contact information: [Regional Center](https://sdmis.nios.ac.in/home/regional-center)).
3. You have to send all documents to the RC physically as well.
4. Please email me at tamimtasira[at]gmail(dot)com if you encounter any problems.
5. Do not wait for the datesheet. Send the documents to the RC after your exam fees are paid.
6. The RC will mail you a letter. Take a printout of that letter and use it.
