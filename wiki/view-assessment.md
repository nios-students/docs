Everything about view assessment
------------------
What is this?
Firstly this **ONLY FOR [PE](https://nios-students.pages.dev/wiki/Exams-Assignments) students only** You can whether your [AI (Study Center)](https://nios-students.pages.dev/wiki/Glossary#:~:text=AI/SC%3A%20Accredited%20Institutes/Study%20Centre) has entered the practical 
 marks or not. "Marks Awarded" "Marks not awarded" **NOT ANY NUMBERS** I know it's kinda pointless.

# How to check it?

**Step-1** Go to
https://exams.nios.ac.in/auth/view-student-formative-assessment (Ignore what is written on the URL)

**Step-2** Enter your enrollment number and DOB and chose “**summative assessment**”

**Step-3** View it!

Here's example of how it looks.
