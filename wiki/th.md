Guidelines for Theory Exam
---------------------------

# Important Checklist

Documents and items you are required to take for the theory exam:
- **ID card of NIOS**
- **ID proof** (Aadhar Card, Passport, License, etc.)
- **Hall ticket for Theory**
- **Stationery** (Pen, Pencil, Pad, etc.)
- **Water bottle**
- **Bag** to put your belongings in

*Black, white, and xerox copies of documents are accepted.*

# Things to know **before** the exam
- **Download the map** of your exam centre and visit your centre beforehand.
- While the hall ticket states that **phones aren't allowed**, most centres don't mind if they are kept in a bag **outside the exam hall**. Just ensure that the phone is powered off or on silent mode. Most centres will have a place to keep the bag.
- For [public exam students](/wiki/Exams-Assignments#pe-public-examination), you will get **15 minutes** to read the question paper. Use this time to understand the questions.
