> Please note that **students of stream 2 don't have to pay exam fees for the first time.**

# ODE (On-Demand Examination)
ODEs are held throughout the year (excluding April-May and October-November) for students who want to write their examinations when they wish to. You can give as many attempts as you wish!  
Eligibility criteria for writing ODE: all students admitted under **stream 1, 3, and 4.**

# TMA (Tutor Marked Assignment)
TMA is crucial for students as it carries **20% weightage of your theory paper.** [See subject-wise marks](https://drive.google.com/). It is uploaded online on the [SDMIS website](https://sdmis.nios.ac.in/auth) only. TMA for vocational subjects **does not exist** (e.g., Data Entry-632). TMA is just Q&A: they will ask you questions, and you are supposed to write the answers, take pictures, make a PDF file, and then upload them. TMA is only applicable for learners admitted under **stream 1. No TMA for other streams.**

**Dates of TMA:**
- **Block-1 April:** Starts in November, due on __31st January__
- **Block-2 October:** Starts in June, due on __31st July__

# Practical Examination/SA
Practical examinations are conducted at your study centre/AI (in most cases) 1 month before the public exams. For on-demand exams, **please ask at the exam center for the date and time on the day of the theory paper.** [Detailed info on practicals](/wiki/pr)

**Dates of Practical Exam:**
- **Block-1 April:** March
- **Block-2 October:** September

# PCP (Personal Contact Programme)
As we know, NIOS is an “open and distance learning system” wherein students don't have to go to school every day. PCP classes aren't meant for explaining the textbook; they are meant for doubt clearing. There are a total of **35 classes**:
- 30 for doubt clearing (these do not carry any marks)
- 05 classes for **only** practical subjects. These carry **50% weightage of practicals**, i.e., if a subject has 20 max marks, 10 are for FA PCPs and 10 for the Practical exam, also known as SA/Sixth PCP/Final PCP.  
PCP classes are for **stream-1 learners only**, and the marks for other streams transfer over to SA/Practical exams [see this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19auYIHocmCcdMysj0dB0FeP_TciA5G_l/view?usp=drivesdk).  

There are two types of PCPs:
1. **PCP/Doubt Clearing:** You ask the teacher doubts.
2. **FA Practical PCP:** The teacher helps prepare for the practical file/record book and explains what to do in the practical examinations.

**Dates of PCPs:**
   
  **Block-1 April**
  - PCP/Doubt Clearing: **Nov-Jan**
  - FA PCP: **Feb-Mar**
    
   **Block-2 October**
  - PCP/Doubt Clearing: **May-June**
  - FA PCP: **Aug-Sept**
