# PCP (Personal Contact Programme)

As we know that NIOS is an “open and distance learning system” wherein students don't have to go to school every day. PCP classes aren't meant for explaining the textbook. they are meant for doubt clearing. There are a total of **35 classes**:
- 30 for doubt clearing (these do not carry any marks)
- 05 classes for ONLY practical subjects. These carry **50% weightage of practical** i.e. if a sebject has 20 max marks. 10 for FA PCPs and 10 for Practical exam also known as SA/Sixth PCP/Final PCP.

PCP classes are for **stream-1 learners only**, and the marks for other streams transfer over to SA/Practical exam [see this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19auYIHocmCcdMysj0dB0FeP_TciA5G_l/view?usp=drivesdk).

There are two types of PCPs:
1. **PCP/Doubt Clearing:** You ask the teacher doubts.
2. **FA Practical PCP:** Teacher helps prepare for the practical file/record book and explains what to do in the practical examinations.

**Dates of PCPs:**
   
  **Block-1 April**
