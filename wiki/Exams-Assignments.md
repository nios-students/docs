# Examination / TMA / Practical info

### Public Examination

The Public Examinations are held twice a year in the months of April-May and October-November on dates fixed by the NIOS for students.
### On Demand Examination

On Demand Examinations are held throughout the year* (excluding april-may oct-nov months)* for students who want to write their examinations when they wish to. You can give as many attempts as you wish!
### TMA (Tutor Marked Assignment)

Tutor Marked Assignment is crucial for students as it carries atleast 20% weightage on your final report card. It can be uploaded online in NIOS portal. TMA for vocational subjects does not exist (data entry 632) etc. TMA is just QnA. They will ask you questions, and you are supposed to write the answers, take pictures, make a pdf file, and then upload them online. TMA is only applicable for the learners admitted under Stream-I of NIOS. TMA is not there for students of Stream-2,3 & 4.
### Practical Exams
Practical examinations are conducted at your study centre/AI (in mhh cases) 1 month before the public exams. For on-demand exams, they are conducted the next day after the theory exams. For more info
