### TMA (Tutor Marked Assignment)

TMA is crucial for students as it carries 20% weightage of your theory paper [See this sebject wise marks](https://drive.google.com/) It is uploaded online on the [NIOS portal](https://sdmis.nios.ac.in/auth) only. TMA for vocational subjects **does not exist** (e.g., Data Entry-632). TMA is just Q&A 
they will ask you questions, and you are supposed to write the answers, take pictures, make a PDF file, and then upload them online. [For details on how to make TMA](https://nios-students.pages.dev/wiki/Guidelines). TMA is only applicable for learners admitted under **Stream-1 of NIOS. No TMA for other streams**

**Dates of TMA:**
- **Block-1 April:** Starts in December, due on 31st January.
- **Block-2 October:** Starts in June, due on 31st July.

*Note: You **must** submit your TMAs of all subjects in the first year even if you are not giving those  subject(s)*
e.g
I'm giving eng-302 DDO-336  Math-311 and i plan to give others in the next year I'll submit others  too namely chem-312 CS-330

### PCP (Personal Contact Programme)

As we know that NIOS is an open and distance learning system where students don't have to go to school every day. PCP classes aren't meant for explaining the textbook; they are meant for doubt clearing. There are a total of 35 classes:
- 30 for doubt clearing (these do not carry any marks)
- 05 classes for ONLY practical subjects (these carry 50% of the practical marks) [See this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19auYIHocmCcdMysj0dB0FeP_TciA5G_l/view?usp=drivesdk)

PCP classes are for **Stream-1 learners only**, and the marks for other streams transfer over to SA/Practical exam [See this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19auYIHocmCcdMysj0dB0FeP_TciA5G_l/view?usp=drivesdk).

There are two types of PCPs:
1. **PCP/Doubt Clearing:** You ask the teacher doubts.
2. **FA Practical PCP:** Teacher helps prepare for the practical file/record book and explains what to do in the practical examinations.
