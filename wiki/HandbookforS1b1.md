| **Aspect**            | **Inheritance**                                    | **Succession**                                       |

| **Definition**        | Transfer of property to legal heirs when there is no will. | General process of passing on property after death, with or without a will. |
| **Type**              | Always intestate (no will).                       | Can be either testamentary (with a will) or intestate (without a will).     |
| **Scope**             | Specific to distributing property according to legal or religious laws. | Covers both the creation of a will and the distribution of property.       |
| **Legal Framework**   | Governed by laws that dictate who the heirs are and what they receive. | Includes laws governing the creation and execution of wills, as well as intestate distribution. |
| **Right by Birth**    | Typically includes rules about who is entitled to inherit based on birthright (e.g., children, spouses). | Considers both those named in a will and legal heirs under intestate laws. |
| **Process**           | Automatic distribution according to legal guidelines. | Involves both the distribution by will and legal processes for intestate cases. |
| **Example**           | A child inherits their parent’s property because the parent died without a will. | A person’s estate is distributed according to their will, or, if no will exists, according to inheritance laws. |
