# Admission

__Admissions are completely online from [sdmis.nios.ac.in](https://sdmis.nios.ac.in) only__ (For 12th (Sr. Sec), 10th (Sec), and OBE).

# Secondary (10th Standard)

This course is equivalent to the Xth standard. However, NIOS integrates 9th and 10th into one grade. The content of 9th and 10th is present in its books. Unlike other boards, you may choose your subjects from the [table](https://www.nios.ac.in/departmentsunits/academic/senior-secondary-course-equivalent-to-class-xii.aspx).

**Exceptions**

1. a) You are required to take __at least 1 language subject__.

   b) You __can take up to 2 language subject(s)__ e.g., Hindi and English ***✔*** ~~Hindi, English, and Arabic~~ ***X***.

2. a) You are required to opt for __4 academic subjects for "certification"__ (*not* including language subjects).  
   > [!NOTE]  
   > The reason why "certification" is in quotes is because part/dual students don't get a certificate. They just pass specific subjects that they need for their career.  
   > e.g., For taking admission into a commercial pilot course, one of the requirements is that the student has to study Physics and Mathematics in 12th. So, they register in part admission to fulfill the requirements.  
   > **IF** you just passed 8th/9th (i.e., a fresher), you must click **NO** for part admission when registering/filling the admission form.

   b) You can add 2 __more subjects, but the maximum count of subjects shouldn't exceed seven (i.e., no more than 7 subjects)__.

   c) You can choose one vocational subject.

   d) NIOS lets you choose any subject; however, you **MUST** choose your subjects according to your future career/goals.

   e) Don't think that you can complete 12th in one year. __If you passed out of 10th, you are required to maintain a 1-year gap between passing 10th and completing 12th.__

# Senior Secondary (12th Standard)

This course is equivalent to the 12th standard. However, NIOS integrates 11th and 12th into one grade. The content of 11th and 12th is present in its books. Unlike other boards, you may choose your subjects from the [table](https://www.nios.ac.in/departmentsunits/academic/senior-secondary-course-equivalent-to-class-xii.aspx).

Procedure: NIOS has introduced __100% online__ admission to facilitate learners in registering themselves. Offline admission quotas have been dispensed with. Under this scheme, learners have the options to:
- Register themselves online directly.
- Visit their Regional Centres/Study Centres for online registration. (*They aren't helpful mostly.*)  
> [!TIP]  
> Though we suggest that you register yourself for admission from the [NIOS SDMIS website](https://sdmis.nios.ac.in), it's easy!

# Streams of Admission

In NIOS, there are __primarily four streams__. Unlike other boards, you can choose whatever subjects you like. The term "stream" in the context of NIOS isn't Science, Commerce, Humanities, and Arts; it’s based on factors such as whether you are taking Public Exams or On-Demand Exams.

# Stream 2
This stream is available for learners who have failed or passed but want to improve scores in the Secondary or Senior Secondary (10th class or 12th class) examination from a recognized board and want to update their qualification in one or up to four subjects to meet eligibility criteria for their goals (e.g., admission into a commercial pilot course). These exams are available to write during October-November Public Examinations.

> [!WARNING]  
> For students enrolled in Stream 2, **examination fees are included in the admission fees for the first time.**

# Stream 3 and 4
On-Demand Examination System (ODES) at Secondary Level (10th class) and Senior Secondary Level (12th class). Open for admissions throughout the year. Suitable for learners seeking to update their qualifications or clear failed subjects. [More Info on Stream 3 & 4](https://rcguwahati.nios.ac.in/registration-for-on-demand-examination-ode-and-procedure.html)

# Transfer of Credit (ToC)
ToC is one of the flagship features of NIOS. **Failed** learners can transfer the marks of **2** subjects from the parent board to NIOS.

**Rules and Norms of ToC:**
- The ToC fee is ₹**230 per subject** (as per NEW notification: [37/2024](https://www.nios.ac.in/media/documents/notification/yr2024/Exam/Notification-34-2024.pdf)).
- The subject you wish to transfer over **must** be in NIOS's curriculum.
- The **original failed marksheet** should be present in **physical form**, and you **must** send it to your Regional Center after confirmation of admission along with a copy of your **admission form**. If you don't send it, ToC won't apply.
