# Admission

__Admissions are completely online at [sdmis.nios.ac.in](https://sdmis.nios.ac.in) only__ (for 12th (Sr. Sec), 10th (Sec), and OBE).

# Secondary (10th Standard)

This course is equivalent to the Xth standard. However, NIOS integrates 9th and 10th into one grade. The content of 9th and 10th grades is present in its books. Unlike other boards, you may choose your subjects from the [table](https://www.nios.ac.in/departmentsunits/academic/senior-secondary-course-equivalent-to-class-xii.aspx).

**Exceptions**

1. a) You are required to take __at least 1 language subject__.

   b) You __can take up to 2 language subjects__, e.g., Hindi and English ***✔*** ~~Hindi, English, and Arabic~~ ***X***.

2. a) You are required to opt for __4 academic subjects for "certification"__ (*not* including language subjects).  
   > [!NOTE]  
   > The reason why "certification" is in quotes is because part/dual students don't get a certificate. They just pass specific subjects that they need for their career.  
   > e.g., For taking admission into a commercial pilot course, one of the requirements is that the student has to study Physics and Mathematics in 12th. So, they register in part admission to fulfill the requirements.  
   > **IF** you just passed 8th/9th (i.e., a fresher), you must click **NO** for part admission when registering/filling the admission form.

   b) You can add 2 __more subjects, but the maximum count of subjects shouldn't exceed seven (i.e., no more than 7 subjects)__.

   c) You can choose one vocational subject.

   d) NIOS lets you choose any subject; however, you **MUST** choose your subjects according to your future career/goals.

   e) Don't think that you can complete 12th in one year. __If you passed out of 10th, you are required to maintain a 1-year gap between passing 10th and completing 12th.__

# Senior Secondary (12th Standard)

This course is equivalent to the 12th standard. However, NIOS integrates 11th and 12th into one grade. The content of 11th and 12th grades is present in its books. Unlike other boards, you may choose your subjects from the [table](https://www.nios.ac.in/departmentsunits/academic/senior-secondary-course-equivalent-to-class-xii.aspx).

Procedure: NIOS has introduced __100% online__ admission to facilitate learners in registering themselves. Offline admission quotas have been dispensed with. Under this scheme, learners have the options to:
- Register themselves online directly.
- Visit their Regional Centres/Study Centres for online registration. (*They aren't helpful mostly.*)  
> [!TIP]  
> We suggest that you register yourself for admission through the [NIOS SDMIS website](https://sdmis.nios.ac.in); it's easy!

# Streams of Admission

In NIOS, there are __primarily four streams__. Unlike other boards, you can choose any subjects you like. The term "stream" in the context of NIOS isn't Science, Commerce, Humanities, and Arts; it’s based on factors such as whether you are taking Public Exams or On-Demand Exams.

# Stream 1
Open to all learners and freshers. Admissions are open throughout the year. Examinations are held in April-May for Block 1 learners and October-November for Block 2 learners. (*Although you may give exams in different blocks from yours and [On Demand](https://nios-students.pages.dev/wiki/Exams-Assignments#ode-on-demand-examination), after the first exam is past, you don't have to appear in it.*) Students in Stream 1 must submit TMAs and attend PCP classes. [More info on TMA & PCP](Exams-Assignments) | [Admission schedule Stream I](https://sdmis.nios.ac.in/home/fees#:~:text=Fee%20Structure%20%2D%20(With%20Late%20Fee)%20for%20Stream%201%20Block%20I) | [Registration flow chart](https://dq4kzxd7fbbni.cloudfront.net/static/dist/images/pdf/process-flow/ProcessFlowDetailed_SecSrSec_Stream1and2_June2023.pdf) | [Fee Structure](https://sdmis.nios.ac.in/home/fees#:~:text=Fee%20Structure%20%2D%20(Without%20Late%20Fee)%20for%20Stream%201%20of%20Online%20Admission)

# Stream 2
This stream is available for learners who have failed or passed but want to improve scores in the Secondary or Senior Secondary (10th class or 12th class) examination from a recognized board and want to update their qualification in one or up to four subjects to meet eligibility criteria for their goals (e.g., admission into a commercial pilot course). These exams are conducted during October-November Public Examinations.

> [!WARNING]  
> For students enrolled in Stream 2, **examination fees are included in the admission fees for the first time.**

# Stream 3 and 4
On-Demand Examination System (ODES) at Secondary Level (10th class) and Senior Secondary Level (12th class). Open for admissions throughout the year. Suitable for learners seeking to update their qualifications or clear failed subjects. [More Info on Stream 3 & 4](https://rcguwahati.nios.ac.in/registration-for-on-demand-examination-ode-and-procedure.html)

# Transfer of Credit (ToC)
ToC is one of the flagship features of NIOS. **Failed** learners can transfer the marks of **2** subjects from the parent board to NIOS.

**Rules and Norms of ToC:**
- The ToC fee is ₹**230 per subject** (as per NEW notification: [37/2024](https://www.nios.ac.in/media/documents/notification/yr2024/Exam/Notification-34-2024.pdf)).
- The subject you wish to transfer must be in NIOS's curriculum.
- The **original failed marksheet** should be present in **physical form**, and you **must** send it to your Regional Center after confirmation of admission along with a copy of your **admission form**. If you don't send it, the ToC won't apply.

# Dual Enrollment or Part Admission

The NIOS offers a Dual Enrollment or Part Admission scheme designed for students who have already passed their 10th or 12th grade from a recognized board but wish to improve their marks in specific subjects or meet eligibility criteria for certain professional courses. It may also be chosen by students who wish to pursue subjects not available in their schools.

**What is NIOS Dual Enrollment?**  
Under this scheme, students can reappear for up to four subjects of their choice through NIOS's On-Demand Examination (ODE) system. This allows learners to schedule exams at their convenience throughout the year, providing them with an opportunity to add to their academic records without enrolling in a full-time course.

**Eligibility Criteria**  
Students eligible for Dual Enrollment or Part Admission include:
- Those currently studying in a regular school.
- Individuals who have already passed the Secondary (10th) or Senior Secondary (12th) examination or any higher course from a recognized Board or University.

**Certification Details**  
Upon successfully passing the selected subjects, NIOS issues a marksheet reflecting the improved scores. However, no additional certificates such as a migration certificate, transfer certificate, or provisional certificate are provided under this scheme, as it is not a complete high school diploma.

**Who Should Consider This?**  
The Dual Enrollment option is particularly beneficial for:
- Students aiming to improve their scores in specific subjects to meet the eligibility criteria for competitive exams or entry requirements.
- Learners seeking to fulfill subject requirements for professional courses, such as obtaining Math and Physics credits necessary for aviation programs.
- Learners wishing to pursue subjects that are not available in their schools.

> [!NOTE]  
> Some universities, like Delhi University, do not accept subjects completed via dual enrollment. For example, if a student has studied humanities through CBSE and completed Mathematics through NIOS, they cannot apply to DU’s Economics program, as all the required subjects need to be in the main high school diploma. So please check your university’s requirements before choosing this path.

**Admission Process**  
To apply for Dual Enrollment or Part Admission, students should:
1. Visit the NIOS official website.
2. Complete the online admission form, selecting the option for Dual Enrollment or Part Admission.
3. Stream 3 should be chosen if you are a 10th grader, and Stream 4 if you are in Grade 12. These streams will allow you to take the exams year-round (except for April-May and Oct-Nov), as an On-Demand Student.
4. Stream 2 will allow you to take the exam in the Oct-Nov Exam series only.
5. Upload the required documents, including previous marksheets and identification proofs.
6. Pay the applicable admission fees online.
