###### Muslim Laws on Divorce

A husband may divorce his wife by repudiating the marriage without giving any reason. Pronouncement of such words which signify the intention to divorce his wife is sufficient. Initially a wife could not divorce her husband of her own accord. She can divorce her husband only where husband has delegated such rights to her or under an agreement. But after enactment of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939, Muslim wives also got right to dissolve their marriage by an order of the court.
**Oversimplified**

1. Husband's Right A husband can divorce his wife by clearly stating his intention, without needing a reason.
2. Wife's Right Traditionally, a wife couldn’t divorce her husband unless he allowed it or they had an agreement. However, since the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939, wives can now seek a divorce through the court.

###### Muslim Laws On Succession

1. In Muslim Law, all property is one and there is no distinction between ancestral or self acquired or separate property, whereas in Hindu law there is separate and self acquired property.
2. There are no such things as joint family property in a Muslim family whereas,amongst Hindus the concept of joint family property is prevalent.
3. The right of an heir, for the first time, comes into existence on the death of the ancestor. Right by birth is unknown in Muslim law but in Hindu law right in property is vested by birth.
4. Muslim law does not recognize the doctrine of representation. The estate of the deceased person devolves upon his heirs at the moment of his death. The estate vests immediately in each heir in proportion to the share provided
   by the Muslim law. As the interest of each heir is separate and distinct, one
   of a number of heirs cannot be treated as representing the others. Thus, if
   P’s son R dies in the lifetime of P the son of R i.e. grandson of P cannot
   claim his father’s share as representing him but in Hindu law the doctrine
   of representation is recognized.
5. Muslim law does not recognize any interest expectant on the death of another i.e. spes successionis (mere chance of succession) while in Hindu law the doctrine of spes successionis is well recognized.
 **Oversimplifed**

- One Type of Property In Muslim law, all property is treated the same—no difference between ancestral or self-acquired.
- No Joint Family Property Muslim families don’t have joint family property.
- No Birthright  Heirs only get rights after the ancestor dies; no rights by birth.
- No Representation Each heir gets their share immediately after death; heirs don’t represent others.
- No Future Interest  Muslim law doesn’t recognize potential future inheritance.
