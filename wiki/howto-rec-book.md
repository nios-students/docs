1. Record book 
One side lines and other side write i.e. Without lines.
2. Pen any colour works (I used bule) and other stationery stuff.

**Prep work II**

Step-1 Download your lab manual from [nios.ac.in](https://nios.ac.in/online-course-material.aspx#maincontent)

Step-2 Pick where practicals will you write or copy paste from our stuff [__***IT'S FREE!!!!***__](/wiki/other-materials#practical-files)

Step-3 Start by finding pictures or conducting experiments (relevant for computer-related subjects)

Step-4 Copy and paste the aim, objectives, prerequisites, materials required, and precautions. In some subjects, the aim may involve writing/copying the line just below the practical number (no need to match the book's number)

Step-5 Write the procedure (if not provided in some subjects)

Step-6 Write the learner's observation

Step-7 Print out the pictures

Step-8 Copy everything into the record book
