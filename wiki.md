Building Android from start to finish (WIP)

## Getting started

Earlier, Cirrus CI gave the ROM Builders community servers for OSS developement of android builds, as these builds need a lot of resources that most people don't have lying around, like double digit RAM requirements(GB), triple digit storage requirement(GB), a capable processor, a specific linux environment, etc. 

Cirrus CI has discontinued ROM Builders around Nov 2023. Now, [crave.io](https://crave.io) is providing Build Servers with a pretty similar Queue System. It is also a lot more flexible as it allows custom commands, has docker image support, allows entering into build storage without build running, etc.

This guide attempts to help new and old users with android development and using Crave.io through Devspace CLI and alternatively, github actions.
